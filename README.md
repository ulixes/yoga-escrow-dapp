# ðŸ§˜ Yoga Class Escrow dApp

A simple proof-of-concept decentralized application for secure yoga class payments using the Kleros Escrow v2 contract on Arbitrum One.

## Features

- **Secure Payments**: Students pay for yoga classes through escrow
- **Instructor Protection**: Instructors receive payment after providing the service
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in Kleros arbitration for disputes
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for both instructors and students

## How It Works

### For Yoga Instructors:
1. Connect your wallet (MetaMask recommended)
2. Create a new yoga class escrow
3. Set class details (name, description, price, deadline)
4. Share the transaction ID with potential students
5. After the class, students can pay you through the escrow

### For Students:
1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse available transactions
3. Pay for classes you've attended
4. If there's a dispute, it can be resolved through Kleros arbitration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
